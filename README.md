# Swag Labs - Automation Testing with Cypress
This project focuses on enhancing my skills in end-to-end (E2E) test automation using Cypress. The test cases are developed based on those I previously created in Spreadsheet, Trello, and Jira. Additionally, the defect reports have been documented on Trello.

How to install:
- Open folder in VSCode
- Run command npm install --force

## Features
- Using Page Object Patterns
- Combined with JUnit and Mochawesome reporters

## Tech
Here are important tech stacks that I used:

- Node 22.11.0
- NPM 10.9.0
- Cypress 13.5.2
- Chrome

## Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm i --force
npx cypress:e2e
```

Additionally, if you want to try open it on browser.

```sh
